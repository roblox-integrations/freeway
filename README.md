# Freeway -- 100x faster asset iteration on Roblox

### Installation 


1. [Download and install Freeway app](https://github.com/freeway-rbx/freeway/releases)
2. Open the working folder from the app start screen, place you images and obj meshes there
3. Open Roblox Studio, click Plugins, and click Freeway.
4. Follow the instructions in the plugin. 


### Note on meshes support
Freeway only understands single-mesh OBJ files(for now). If your OBJ contains more than one mesh, Freeway will pick the first one. It also can't decimate meshes(yet!), so please make sure your mesh fits the Roblox verts count limit.
